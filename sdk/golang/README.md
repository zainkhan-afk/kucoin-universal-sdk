Welcome to the **Go** implementation of the KuCoin Universal SDK. This SDK is built based on KuCoin API specifications to provide a comprehensive and optimized interface for interacting with the KuCoin platform.

For an overview of the project and SDKs in other languages, refer to the [Main README](https://github.com/kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk).


## 📦 Installation

### Latest Version: `1.1.0`
Install the Golang SDK using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/Kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk/sdk/golang
go mod tidy
```

## 📖 Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you started with the SDK in **Go**.

```golang
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/Kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk/sdk/golang/pkg/api"
	"github.com/Kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk/sdk/golang/pkg/common/logger"
	"github.com/Kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk/sdk/golang/pkg/generate/spot/market"
	"github.com/Kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk/sdk/golang/pkg/types"
	"os"
)

func example() {
	// Use the default logger or supply your custom logger
	defaultLogger := logger.NewDefaultLogger()
	logger.SetLogger(defaultLogger)

	// Retrieve API secret information from environment variables
	key := os.Getenv("API_KEY")
	secret := os.Getenv("API_SECRET")
	passphrase := os.Getenv("API_PASSPHRASE")

	// Set specific options, others will fall back to default values
	httpOption := types.NewTransportOptionBuilder().
		SetKeepAlive(true).
		SetMaxIdleConnsPerHost(10).
		Build()

	// Create a client using the specified options
	option := types.NewClientOptionBuilder().
		WithKey(key).
		WithSecret(secret).
		WithPassphrase(passphrase).
		WithSpotEndpoint(types.GlobalApiEndpoint).
		WithFuturesEndpoint(types.GlobalFuturesApiEndpoint).
		WithBrokerEndpoint(types.GlobalBrokerApiEndpoint).
		WithTransportOption(httpOption).
		Build()
	client := api.NewClient(option)

	// Get the Restful Service
	kuCoinRestService := client.RestService()

	// Get Spot Market API
	spotMarketAPI := kuCoinRestService.GetSpotService().GetMarketAPI()

	request := market.NewGetPartOrderBookReqBuilder().
		SetSymbol("BTC-USDT").
		SetSize("20").
		Build()

	// Query for part orderbook depth data. (aggregated by price)
	response, err := spotMarketAPI.GetPartOrderBook(request, context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		logger.GetLogger().Errorf("failed to get part order book: %v", err)
		return
	}
	logger.GetLogger().Infof("time=%d, sequence=%s, bids=%v, asks=%v", response.Time, response.Sequence, response.Bids, response.Asks)
}

## 📌 Special Notes on APIs

This section provides specific considerations and recommendations for using the REST and WebSocket APIs.

### REST API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Advanced HTTP Handling**:
  - Supports retries, persistent connections, and connection pooling for efficient request handling.
- **Extensible Interceptors**:
  - Provides HTTP interceptors that users can extend to customize request and response processing.
- **Rich Response Details**:
  - Includes rate-limiting information and raw response data in API responses for better debugging and control.
- **Public API Access**:
  - For public endpoints, API keys are not required, simplifying integration for non-authenticated use cases.

---

### WebSocket API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Flexible Service Creation**:
  - Supports creating services for public/private channels in Spot, Futures, or Margin trading as needed.
  - Multiple services can be created independently.
- **Service Lifecycle**:
  - If a service is closed, create a new service instead of reusing it to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Connection-to-Channel Mapping**:
  - Each WebSocket connection corresponds to a specific channel type. For example:
    - Spot public/private and Futures public/private services require 4 active WebSocket connections.

#### Threading and Callbacks
- **Simple Thread Model**:
  - WebSocket services follow a simple thread model, ensuring callbacks are handled on a single thread.
- **Subscription Management**:
  - Subscriptions are synchronous. A subscription is considered successful only after receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) from the server.
  - Each subscription has a unique ID, which can be used for unsubscribe.

#### Data and Message Handling
- **Framework-Managed Threads**:
  - Data messages are handled by a single framework-managed thread, ensuring orderly processing.
- **Buffer Management**:
  - When the message buffer is full, excess messages are dropped, and a notification event is sent.
- **Duplicate Subscriptions**:
  - Avoid overlapping subscription parameters. For example:
    - Subscribing to `["BTC-USDT", "ETH-USDT"]` and then to `["ETH-USDT", "DOGE-USDT"]` may result in undefined behavior.
    - Identical subscriptions will raise an error for duplicate subscriptions.

## 📑 Parameter Descriptions

This section provides details about the configurable parameters for both HTTP and WebSocket client behavior.
