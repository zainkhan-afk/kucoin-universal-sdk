## 📖 Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you started with the SDK in **Python**.

```python
import logging
import os

from kucoin_universal_sdk.api.client import DefaultClient
from kucoin_universal_sdk.generate.spot.market.model_get_part_order_book_req import GetPartOrderBookReqBuilder
from kucoin_universal_sdk.model.client_option import ClientOptionBuilder
from kucoin_universal_sdk.model.constants import GLOBAL_API_ENDPOINT, GLOBAL_FUTURES_API_ENDPOINT, \
    GLOBAL_BROKER_API_ENDPOINT
from kucoin_universal_sdk.model.transport_option import TransportOptionBuilder


def example():
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
    )

    #  Retrieve API secret information from environment variables
    key = os.getenv("API_KEY", "")
    secret = os.getenv("API_SECRET", "")
    passphrase = os.getenv("API_PASSPHRASE", "")

    # Set specific options, others will fall back to default values
    http_transport_option = (
        TransportOptionBuilder()
        .set_keep_alive(True)
        .set_max_pool_size(10)
        .set_max_connection_per_pool(10)
        .build()
    )

    # Create a client using the specified options
    client_option = (
        ClientOptionBuilder()
        .set_key(key)
        .set_secret(secret)
        .set_passphrase(passphrase)
        .set_spot_endpoint(GLOBAL_API_ENDPOINT)
        .set_futures_endpoint(GLOBAL_FUTURES_API_ENDPOINT)
        .set_broker_endpoint(GLOBAL_BROKER_API_ENDPOINT)
        .set_transport_option(http_transport_option)
        .build()
    )
    client = DefaultClient(client_option)

    # Get the Restful Service
    kucoin_rest_service = client.rest_service()

    spot_market_api = kucoin_rest_service.get_spot_service().get_market_api()

    # Query for part orderbook depth data. (aggregated by price)
    request = GetPartOrderBookReqBuilder().set_symbol("BTC-USDT").set_size("20").build()
    response = spot_market_api.get_part_order_book(request)
    logging.info(f"time={response.time}, sequence={response.sequence}, "
                 f"bids={response.bids}, asks={response.asks}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    example()

## 🏗️ Technical Design

The KuCoin Universal SDK is built with a code-generation-first approach to ensure consistency, scalability, and rapid updates across all supported languages. By leveraging the OpenAPI Specification and a custom code generator, the SDK achieves the following advantages:

- **Consistency**: All SDKs provide a unified experience by adhering to the same core design principles, regardless of the programming language.
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows for easy extension of functionality and quick adaptation to API changes.
- **Rapid Updates**: Updates to the API can be seamlessly reflected in all SDKs by simply regenerating the code from the updated specifications.
- **Language-Specific Optimization**: Generated code follows idiomatic practices of the target language, ensuring a natural developer experience.

This design ensures that developers can rely on the SDK for high-quality, up-to-date, and consistent integrations across all languages.

### 🔧 Code Generation Workflow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Documentation Description Meta File] --> B[Preprocessor]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2
    B --> C1[OpenAPI Specification 1]
    B --> C2[OpenAPI Specification 2]
    style C1 fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2
    style C2 fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2
    C1 --> D[Code Generator]
    C2 --> D[Code Generator]
    D --> E[Final Code]
```

1. **OpenAPI Specification**:
   - All SDKs are generated based on the official KuCoin OpenAPI specifications.
   - This ensures that the SDK always aligns with the latest API updates.

2. **Code Generator**:
   - The SDK leverages a custom code generator built on top of the OpenAPI Generator.
   - The generator is tailored to produce idiomatic code for each target language, adhering to its conventions and best practices.

3. **Generated Code Structure**:
   - Each language SDK is organized into specific modules to provide clear separation of concerns and ease of use.
   - Consistent abstractions ensure similar functionality and design principles across all supported languages.
